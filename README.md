# Getting Started with Create React App - template with typescript

### Application created from scratch for recruitment process needs.

#### Used technologies in the project:

-   styled-components
-   react (hooks + context API)
-   typescript
-   eslint - code linter
-   prettier - code formatter (synchronised with eslint rules)
-   react-router-dom - routing plugin for react
-   react-helmet-async - providing SEO optimizations (ie. title, description meta tags etc.)

#### What would i do with the current state of the application if I had more time:

- refactor the code to make it more optimized and bugs free
- make unit tests and also check if the components are written in good way (testability)
- add pagination for posts page - better UX
- add some pre-commit hooks for cleaner code (husky-hooks)


#### CASE WITH THE TASK ITSEL:

I wasn't sure what to put into "commenter name" field, because recommended endpoint in the task did not have the resource of the user name, I used the email instead.
